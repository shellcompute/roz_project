# roz_project
Reports of Zentao PMS, ROZ for short. 

The source-opened Project Management System of ZenTao is popular and helpful.
However, in some cases, we need more special reports based on the PMS.

This project is a beginning, we want to do something more for the customized
reports, and beautiful data-charts, which is mainly based on the famous ECharts.

Everyone who may help us improving the project would be welcomed and encouraged.

## Framework

| Unit | Component Selection |
| ----: | :-----: |
| Web Library | jQuery, Echarts |
| Web Framework | Flask |
| Database | share with ZenTao DB(MySQL) |

### Features

- light weighted, we use Python and Flask to make everything simple.
- easy development
- easy deployment, users only need to unzip it and run.
- easy to use.

Attention: The deployed system would serve managers and team leaders only,
the user amount would be limited. **It CANNOT be used for large amount of users
and high concurrent scenarios**.
